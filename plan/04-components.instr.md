# Step 4: Component & Screen Specification

**Goal:** Create a detailed, non-visual blueprint of each screen to be translated directly into code.

**Instructions:**

1.  Take the `APP_SPEC.md` file you've been working on.
2.  Append the content from `plan/04-components.tmpl.md`.
3.  **Define Reusable Components:** For each reusable element in your design, define its name, properties (props), and actions.
4.  **Detail Each Screen:** For every screen, specify its route, layout, and a full component tree.
5.  This is the final step for the `APP_SPEC.md` file. Once complete, it will be the full specification for the application's front-end.
