# Step 3: High-Fidelity Mockups & Asset Export

**Goal:** Create the final look and feel and export all necessary visual assets.

**Instructions:**

1.  Using a vector design tool (like Figma), create high-fidelity mockups for each screen.
2.  **Export Screen Mockups:** Export each complete screen as an SVG file into `plan/03-mockups.out/mockups/`.
3.  **Export Individual Assets:** Export all icons and logos as individual SVG files into `plan/03-mockups.out/public/assets/`.
4.  **Update the Specification:** Append the content from `plan/03-mockups.tmpl.md` to your `APP_SPEC.md` file.
5.  Modify the markdown to correctly link to the screen mockups you exported.
