# Step 5: Architecture Definition

**Goal:** Document the high-level technical architecture to ensure the code is clean, scalable, and easy to work on together.

**Instructions:**

1.  Create a new file named `ARCHITECTURE.md` in `plan/05-arch.out/`.
2.  Copy the content from `plan/05-arch.tmpl.md` into your new `ARCHITECTURE.md` file.
3.  Review the architectural principles and modify or extend them to better suit the specific needs of your application.
4.  The final `ARCHITECTURE.md` file is the deliverable for this step.
