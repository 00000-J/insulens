# Step 1: Core Concepts & User Flow

**Goal:** Define the core features and user navigation of the application.

**Instructions:**

1.  Create a new file named `APP_SPEC.md` inside the `plan/01-concepts.out/` directory.
2.  Copy the content from `plan/01-concepts.tmpl.md` into your new `APP_SPEC.md` file.
3.  **Fill in the User Stories:** Based on the application you want to build, define the key features from a user's perspective.
4.  **Complete the User Flow:** Edit the Mermaid diagram to accurately represent the screens in your app and the user's navigation path between them.
5.  The resulting `APP_SPEC.md` file is the deliverable for this step.
